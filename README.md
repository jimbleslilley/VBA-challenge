# VBA-challenge

Hi, for this homework, I worked in two very long blocks and did not upload to my repository with changes unfortunately. 

VBA 02 Homework James Lilley.cls
This contains the finished script and will run correctly on the appropraite stock market documents. 

There will be additional .cls documents marked appropriately, these are previous versions of my code. To better show development of ideas/concepts and to provide evidence against plaugarism. Sources have been cited where appropriate in VBA 02 Homework James Lilley.cls.
